# vocally
Vocally is a voice impersonator being created in Python 3.6, using the PyTorch and librosa libraries. I am creating this to get familiarized with using convolutional neural network (CNN) models.

The CNN model and utils.py file have been collected from https://github.com/mazzzystar/randomCNN-voice-transfer using PyGithub via gitscrape.py
